## [7DaysOfCode](https://7daysofcode.io/matricula/java)
Project to use only **[![Java Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-ED8B00?style=flat-square&logo=java&logoColor=white&link=https://www.java.com/)](https://www.java.com/)** APIs to consume an API, pulling the ranking of the top 250 movies from [IMDB](https://imdb-api.com/api?utm_source=ActiveCampaign&utm_medium=email&utm_content=%237DaysOfCode+-+Java+1%2F7%3A+Consumir+uma+API+de+filmes&utm_campaign=%5BAlura+%237Days+Of+Code%5D%28Java%29+Dia+1%2F7%3A+Consumir+uma+API+de+filmes) and returning a JSON.

> DAY 1
On the first day, you will make your Java code consume the IMDB API, fetch the top 250 movies from their list and print the corresponding JSON in the console.

> DAY 2
On that day, you will parse the JSON response obtained from IMDB to extract its information and attributes (like title, poster, note, etc).

> DAY 3
Here, you will start to model your code in a better way, thinking a little about Object Orientation. You will create a 'Movie' structure with some attributes, with the intention that each object of this type encapsulates its own data.

> DAY 4
It's time to play with HTML! In today's challenge, you will work with the output and generate an HTML page from the list of objects you obtained earlier. The idea will be to create an HTML page where you can see the information about the movie, including the poster and the note.

> DAY 5
At this point, you will have made a lot of strides in code modeling, but you will likely still have exposed code. Your task will be to encapsulate some of the calls developed so far in new classes.

> DAY 6
Here you will see an important and very high level point. Your challenge will be to make your code more generic, that is, prepared to receive data from other APIs. For this you will use interfaces.

> DAY 7
On the seventh and final day of the challenge, you will be able to sort your list based on different attributes, using the Collections class and the Comparable and Comparator interfaces. You will close with a golden key!
